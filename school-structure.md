# Location

The school will be held on the Fort Gary Campus of the [University of Manitoba](). More specifically, participants will be housed and lectures will take place at St John's College.


# School structure

## Lectures
Each day includes three 1.5-hour sessions by mathematicians and biologists, covering
biological problems, theoretical concepts, applications, and computational tools. To ensure the access to the material, lecture notes, slides, and codes are uploaded to GitHub.

## Project Work
Students work in small, diverse groups on assigned research problems, applying lecture
content. Instructors provide guidance, and students present their findings at the end of the school in oral presentations and written reports. Students are grouped based on their academic and geographic backgrounds, promoting collaborative learning and research.

## Lecture 1: Analysis of reaction-diffusion systems on stationary domains

In this lecture I will cover the formulation of reaction-diffusion systems from first principles and then carry out non-dimensionalisation, Turing diffusion-driven instability, and parameter estimation and mode isolation. 

## Lecture 2:  Numerical methods for reaction-diffusion system on stationary domains

In this lecture, I will introduce numerical methods for reaction-diffusion systems on stationary domains (finite differences and finite elements)

## Lecture 3: High performance numerical methods for PDEs

In this lecture delivered jointly with Victor Juma, we will introduce open source software packages for solving PDEs. For example, FeNiCS and multigrid methods (this last one if time permits) and how to run computations on the cluster.

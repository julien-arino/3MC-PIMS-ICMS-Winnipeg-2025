### Lecture 1: Derivation of reaction-diffusion systems on continuously deforming domains and surfaces



### Lecture 2:  Finite element methods for reaction-diffusion systems on continuously deforming domains and surfaces



### Lecture 3: Solving reaction-diffusion systems using FeNiCs

In this lecture delivered jointly with Victor Juma, we will introduce open source software packages for solving PDEs. For example, FeNiCS and multigrid methods (this last one if time permits) and how to run computations on the cluster.

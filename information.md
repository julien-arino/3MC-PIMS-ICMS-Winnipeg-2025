This research school is organized by the [Maud Menten Institute](https://maudmenteninstitute.org/) and  part of a series of events that emerges from the collaboration of three bodies: The [3MC program](https://natural-sciences.nwu.ac.za/paa/3MC) (South Africa), [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/) (Canada) and [ICMS](https://www.icms.org.uk/) (UK). 



# Location

The school will be held on the Fort Gary Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). More specifically, participants will be housed and lectures will take place at [St John's College](https://umanitoba.ca/st-johns-college/).


# School structure

## Schedule

The tentative schedule can be accessed [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-PIMS-ICMS-Winnipeg-2025/schedule).

## Lectures
Each day includes three 1.5-hour sessions by mathematicians and biologists, covering biological problems, theoretical concepts, applications, and computational tools. To ensure the access to the material, lecture notes, slides, and codes are uploaded to GitHub.

## Project Work
Students work in small, diverse groups on assigned research problems, applying lecture content. Instructors provide guidance, and students present their findings at the end of the school in oral presentations and written reports. Students are grouped based on their academic and geographic backgrounds, promoting collaborative learning and research.


# Topics

The summer school aims to equip students with essential tools and methodologies for investigating complex molecular and cellular questions. Courses will cover techniques relevant to structural, molecular, and cellular biology, all driven by specific biological questions.  Cancer will be used as an integrative example throughout the program.

This research school is organized by the [Maud Menten Institute](https://maudmenteninstitute.org/) and  part of a series of events that emerges from the collaboration of three bodies: The [3MC program](https://natural-sciences.nwu.ac.za/paa/3MC) (South Africa), [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/) (Canada) and [ICMS](https://www.icms.org.uk/) (UK). 



# Venue

The school will be held on the Fort Gary Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). Lectures, project work, coffee breaks and meals will take place at [St John's College](https://umanitoba.ca/st-johns-college/) (SJC).

## Supported non-local students
Supported non-local students will be housed at the St John’s College Residence (17 Sifton Road). Breakfasts, lunches and dinners will also be provided for the duration of your time at the Daily Bread Café, within the St. John's College building. Each room is supplied with linens and towels, but please remember to bring your own toiletries.

When you arrive at 17 Sifton Road, please call the Don on duty at (204) 291-5687, who will assist you with your check-in and help you get settled. A Don is on duty 24/7.



## Supported local students
Lunches and dinners will be provided for the duration of the school at the Daily Bread Café.

# School structure

## Schedule

The schedule with rooms can be accessed [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-PIMS-ICMS-Winnipeg-2025/schedule).

## Lectures
Each day includes four to three 1.5-hour sessions by mathematicians and biologists, covering biological problems, theoretical concepts, applications, and computational tools. To ensure the access to the material, lecture notes, slides, and codes are uploaded to GitHub.

## Project Work
Students work in small, diverse groups on assigned research problems, applying lecture content. Instructors provide guidance during "Suprevised project" session, and students present their findings at the end of the school in oral presentations and written reports. Students are grouped based on their academic and geographic backgrounds, promoting collaborative learning and research.


# Topics

The summer school aims to equip students with essential tools and methodologies for investigating complex molecular and cellular questions. Courses will cover techniques relevant to structural, molecular, and cellular biology, all driven by specific biological questions.  Cancer will be used as an integrative example throughout the program.

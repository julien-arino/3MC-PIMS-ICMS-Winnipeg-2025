This research school is organized by the [Maud Menten Institute](https://maudmenteninstitute.org/) and  part of a series of events that emerges from the collaboration of three bodies: The [3MC program](https://natural-sciences.nwu.ac.za/paa/3MC) (South Africa), [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/) (Canada) and [ICMS](https://www.icms.org.uk/) (UK). 


The summer school aims to equip students with essential tools and methodologies for investigating complex molecular and cellular questions. Courses will cover techniques relevant to structural, molecular and cellular biology, all driven by specific biological questions.  Cancer will be used as an integrative example throughout the program.


# Venue

The school will be held on the Fort Gary Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). Lectures, project work, coffee breaks and meals will take place at [St John's College](https://umanitoba.ca/st-johns-college/) (SJC).

## Supported non-local students
Supported non-local students will be housed at the St John’s College Residence (17 Sifton Road). Breakfasts, lunches and dinners will also be provided for the duration of your time at the Daily Bread Café, within the St John's College building. Each room is supplied with linens and towels, but please remember to bring your own toiletries.

When you arrive at 17 Sifton Road, please call the Don on duty at (204) 291-5687, who will assist you with your check-in and help you get settled. A Don is on duty 24/7.



## Supported local students
Lunches and dinners will be provided for the duration of the school at the Daily Bread Café.

## Schedule

The schedule with rooms can be accessed [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-PIMS-ICMS-Winnipeg-2025/schedule).

## Lectures
Each day includes four to three 1.5-hour sessions by mathematicians and biologists, covering biological problems, theoretical concepts, applications and computational tools. 

To ensure the access to the material, lecture notes, slides and codes will be uploaded to a shared drive. Link to access the shared drive will be circulated at the begining of the school.

## Project Work
Students will work in small groups on assigned research projects, applying the concepts covered in the lectures. Project topics will be presented on June 16th from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm. A Google form will be circulated afterward, asking students to indicate their first, second, and third choices for project topics.

Groups will be formed based on students’ preferences, academic backgrounds, and geographic diversity to foster collaborative learning and research.

Instructors will provide guidance during the “Supervised Project” sessions held every weekday from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm.

Each group will present their findings in an oral presentation on Friday, June 27th, and submit a written report by Thursday, June 26th.

## Topics
### Biological interests
* Structures and topology of molecules
* Transport in cells
* Proteins interactions and signalling pathways 
* Cell shapes and structures 
* Cell migration
* Introduction of cancer biology

### Methodology 
* Graph theory and applications in biology
* Geometric and statistical methods in biological data analysis 
* Mathematical and computational modelling of cellular and molecular biology
* Stochastic processes and dynamical systems in biological systems 
 

# Getting around

The school will be held on the [Fort Garry](https://umanitoba.ca/about-um/our-campuses) (main) Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/), located in the south end of the city.  

Fast direct bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a *University of Manitoba* destined bus, not one headed to *Saint Norbert*. 
Other bus lines connecting downtown to the campus are the 47 and the 60 lines.

# [Winnipeg](https://www.meetingswinnipeg.com/conference/3mc-pims-idms-icms-summer-school)

[Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada and is home to close to 800,000 people.

What's happening in Winnipeg during/around the days of the school: [here](https://www.meetingswinnipeg.com/conference/conference-events)

Things to do in Winnipeg (some ideas):
- [Canadian Museum for Human Rights](https://humanrights.ca/), the only Canadian national museum outside of the Ottawa region, has the aim to "explore the subject of human rights with a special but not exclusive reference to Canada, to enhance the public's understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and dialogue."
- [The Forks](https://www.theforks.com/) is located at the junction of the [Assiniboine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiniboine_River) and [Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North) Rivers. Has shops with a variety of touristy stuff, food and beverage vendors.
- The [Winnipeg Art Gallery](https://www.wag.ca/) is home in particular to [Qaumajuq](https://www.wag.ca/about/qaumajuq/).
- Old Saint Boniface, the main French-speaking area in Winnipeg. Saint Boniface is also home to the [Université de Saint-Boniface](https://ustboniface.ca/), the oldest (1818) French-speaking university outside of Québec, as well as to an [interesting cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface_Cathedral), the grounds of which house the tomb of [Louis Riel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel).
- The [Exchange District](https://www.exchangedistrict.org/) is a National Historic Site of Canada comprising many historic buildings as well as Winnipeg's theatre district.
- The [Manitoba Museum](https://manitobamuseum.ca/), located within the Exchange District, is a human and natural history museum. It is home to the collection of the Hudson Bay Company and a replica of the [Nonsuch](https://www.hbcheritage.ca/things/technology/the-nonsuch).
- The recently opened [The Leaf](https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/leaf/lifegrows) and the [Assiniboine Park Zoo](https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/zoo/visit/hours-and-rates) are both located within [Assiniboine Park](https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/), a large urban park and forest.
- Look for [murals](https://themuralsofwinnipeg.com): Winnipeg has hundreds of murals scattered throughout the city
